# trackHub_HCMV

This is a curated selection of existing and new HCMV datasets for viewing in the [UCSC Genome Browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu).

## Usage:

- First go to the [UCSC Genome Browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu).
- Then, navigate to `My Data` > `Track Hubs`.
- Select the `My Hubs` tab.
- Finally, paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/P-TEFb/trackHub_HCMV/master/hub.txt` into the URL field.

You should now be able to select the FJ616285.1 genome and view these tracks!

## About Track Hubs:

Track hubs are collections of experimental data, annotations, and a reference genome assembled in a format recognizable by the [UCSC Genome Browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu). They are intended to make it easier for researchers to view tracks aligned to unsupported or uncommon genomes.

Track hubs were developed and described by Raney BJ, et al. in their [2014 *Bioinformatics* manuscript](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt637) `PMID: 24227676`.
